# rl_gcg
This project is the application of the reinforcement learning algorithm GCG (from https://github.com/gkahn13/gcg) on a quadcopter.
It contains a simulated environment in ROS-Gazebo used for simulations as well as some files from the gcg repository which were changed (compared to the original ones) to run the ROS-Gazebo simulations.
